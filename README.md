## Malaria Parasicite Detection
Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases, many have lost their life because of it.
I have made an model which will detect the cells which contain malaria virus.
I am using FastAI libraries and deploying the model on Google Colab
I am using Resnet-50

Search [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create new python 3 notebook
               OR
open the [notebook](https://github.com/mauryasameer/Malaria_detection/blob/master/fastai.ipynb) and then click on open on colab
